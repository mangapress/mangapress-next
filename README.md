The next generation of Manga+Press, the webcomic management system for WordPress.

### Description

Manga+Press is a webcomic management system for WordPress. Manga+Press uses WordPress' posts, pages and categories to help you keep track of your comic posts. Manga+Press also includes its own custom template tags to help make creating themes easier.


### TODO
 * Re-write comic navigation system
 * Create visual unit tests (CSS/HTML) for comic posts, navigation, etc.
    
    
### Changelog
#### 0.0.1
   * Ground-up rebuild of Manga+Press core. Includes unit tests.

### System Requirements
   * PHP 7 or newer    

### Installation

1. Unpack the .zip file onto your hard drive.

2. Upload the `mangapress-next` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

4. Create two new pages; these pages will be your latest comic and comic archives pages. Label them something like 'Latest Comic' and 'Past Comics' or whatever, as long as it makes sense to you.

6. Click on the Manga+Press Options tab under Settings and go to Basic Manga+Press Options, and set Latest Comic Page, and Comic Archive Page to your two newly created pages.
