                "answer" : "This is because the plugin hasn't been activated for the entire MS network. In order for the child-themes to be available, Manga+Press must be available to the entire network. This can be done by going to **Network Admin > Plugins** and clicking the _Network Activate_ link for Manga+Press. Once this is done, then both the parent- and child-themes need to made available to the network as well. This can be accomplished by going to **Network Admin > Themes**, selecting the themes in question, choosing **Bulk Actions > Network Enable**, and then clicking **Apply**."

                "answer" : "Not by itself. However, Manga+Press doesn't really output markup other than the comic navigation. Responsiveness depends on the theme that is being used. The themes bundled with Manga+Press — the TwentyEleven thru TwentyFourteen child-themes — all have some level of responsiveness that is dependent on their parent themes."

                "question" : "Is Manga+Press compatible with Advanced Custom Fields"
                "answer" : "Yes, it is! Manga+Press is simply a stripped down custom post-type with a custom Featured Image meta-box. Like any other post-type, you can add a new field group using ACF — however, you _will_ have to configure your theme to display these custom fields."

                "question" : "Is Manga+Press compatible with the WPML plugin?"
                "answer" : "I have never had the chance to test Manga+Press with the WPML plugin so I can't really guarantee compatibility. Since Manga+Press works like a standard WordPress post, and WPML _is_ compatible with custom post-types, this shouldn't be a problem."
